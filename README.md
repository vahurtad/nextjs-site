# Personal Website

My personal website is built with React Library for the simplicity, the reusable components, handling data with states, faster virtual DOM. Am also using NextJS for static rendering and grommet framework for responsiveness and accesability every website should include. GraphQL is used to query for the data needed from Github to show my repositories and README content.

#### Prototype

### Timeline

My timeline for this project was to finish within a month. This consisted by starting with making a simple wireframe, then a simple design and finding some features that are useful then iterate this process until I am able to **love** my finished portofolio.

### Collaboration

While this project was done alone, It took me some time to research what I wanted to add, remove, change. Every decision I made was done to make the user experience better for the user.

### Challenges

The biggest challenge was starting from scratch. Finalizing the design, and style guide was a hard goal post to pass as the only requirements I wanted were to have a simple website that is easy to navigate.

I learned that design is not only the hardest but also the most important challenge while also taking into account the time to develop the needed features.

Another big challenge for me was getting GraphQL integration with the correct GraphQL query. After I was able to connect to Github, I found it easy to make the queries that I needed. There was not a lot of help online but with the documentation, I was able to correctly query what I needed.

From my previous experiences, I have learned to take every step of the development is needed to finish the product on time, especially iterating before development starts. If I did not have a design before building my website, I would still be lost in finding the right features, the right colors and the best images rather than the user experience. 
During the start of my iteration and research, I looked at what I wanted: simplicity and user experience. I found articles saved from my weekly newsletters which I had saved and helped me figure out this process better.

### Help
I was able to use GraphQl + Apollo + Node with the help of [HttpLink in this example](https://github.com/brentmclark/node-graphql-playground) with more edits of my own.
